## Introduction to Exec-Timeout

The Cisco "exec-timeout' command sets a specific time of that inactivity timer. Basically, If there is no user input within the indicated time, then session will be closed. therefore to use this command you can change the time slap for timeout, However. this was commonly used in lab, but not in production. You might want to use the special value of 0 that means timeout wil never down.


## Misson
- Change the timeout configuration on both switches


## Hint 
-lab-8 contain the key, therefore go there and try to analyise the things 

Thank You
