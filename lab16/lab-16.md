## Introduction to Etherchannel

Etherchannel combines multiple parallel pairs of the same determined speed between the same pair of switches and packs them into an Etherchannel. The switches treat the Etherchannel as a single interface.



## Misson
- In this lab, Engineer poorly configured the Etherchannel on the Network. 


## Hints 
- Whenever You want to implement Etherchannel after the configuration always see that the configuration logs to verify the whole process.


Thank You
