## Introduction about Packet Tracer

Cisco packet tracer is a User-Friendly netowkr simulator that can be used to strong your network skills. In this simulator, Network Engineer create network topology with lot's of networking device (Router,Switch,etc), Iot, Home devices, etc. and start configured these devices through CLI, and GUI too, and also strong their troubleshooting skills without buying these devices, and networks services. Cisco Packet tracer is created by Cisco. 

The main purpose of Cisco packet tracer simulator is to provide a best way for network enigneer, students to lean the fundamentals of networking, devices configuration, and troubleshotting. therefore We decide to make a lab that already configured, but the configuration is not done properly, it's mean you need to find the way to configuration the labs according the level. 

## Mission  

 - As we start our labs, In this lab You need to find the username and password to access the switch CLI

## Hint
 - Running-Config is a system config file that is in the networking devices memory that act like a RAM,So all process will be delete if device losses their power. therefore You need to stored all configuration on startup-config file that act like a ROM. Because running-config file is not saved. However to save this. You need to use copy command on enable mode.
