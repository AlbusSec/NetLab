## Introduction to Spanning Tree Algorithms 
Spanning-Tree-Protocol(STP) and Rapid Spanning-Tree-Protocol(Rapid STP) allow an ethernet LAN to have the addition of redundant links in a lan because Whenever you implement redundant links on your network without spanning tree algorithm it makes cause, that cause makes many problems on your network, therefore Spanning Tree algorithm allow the network to use redundancy link without any causing some looping problems, Mac stability.


# Misson 
- In this lab, Network Engineer implement redundant link on network with vlan, then implement right spanning-tree-algorithm


# Hint 
- Cisco make Two new spanning-tree-algorithms knowns as Per-Vlan-Spanning-Tree-Plus Protocol (PVST+ protocol) and Rapid Per-Vlan-Spanning-Tree-Plus Protocol (Rapid PVST+ protocol)

Thank You
