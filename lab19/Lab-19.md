## Introduction to Etherchannel load distribution 
Etherchannel Also handle load that was generate from interfaces. But it doesn't distribute the traffic equally among the links. Mean the traffic doesn't goes on a distributed state. The etherchannel uses hash algorithms to forward packets from etherchannels. The calculated load  balancing hash determines which physical interface will be used by etherchannel to forward frame 


## Misson

- Verify that the network engineer correctly configured the EtherChannel, If yes then leave, and if not then configured whole things in the network
- Analyze the load balancing method, therefore If the switch use the src mac method for load balancing, then change it into sec-dst-mac.


## Hint
- Use some show command to verify the etherchannl configurations.

Thank You
