# NetLab
Introduction 
{Basically In our labs you'll get to improve network cli, troubleshooting and configuring skills as it's the only lab related to networking and you'll have to play with devices and change their configuration because they'll be misconfigured so you'll have to perform the tasks and according to them you'll have to configure the device for example in a lab you have to find the misconfigured thing and it will be told you as a hint.
**Please don't check and import the config files unless needed** } 

hum todaa details ki lab bnaa ne kaa reason ku hai dekho jo labs hogi ussmi networking devices ki configuration hogee jo properly  nhi hogi 
toh apkoo task ke according uss device ko configure krnaa hogaa bascally for example ek lab hai toh ussmi device koo misconfigured kiyaa jaayeegaa
or apko find krna hogaa kki kytaa chiz misconfigured hai or yee apko as a hint btyaa jaayeegaa 
config files ko import na kare jab tak need na ho
