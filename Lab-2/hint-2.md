## Introduction to Cisco Catalyst 2960 Switch 

Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series of switches was a modern switch model seriees, but not current model. Current model series of switch is Cisco Catalyst 2960-XR, but In both of these are not a big difference on it. therefore, If you learn about 2960, then you easily configured, and troubleshoot 2960-XR to.
These switches are full-featured, low-cost wiring closet switches for enterprises. The Interface type, as worked in command on these series, is FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet. Overall, Cisco catalyst 2960 Suppose multiple speeds (10/100/1000).  To access a interface You should need to define the interface type and number (Fastethernet 0/1)

## Mission
 - In this lab, You experience the Mac learning process, switch forwarding logic too 

## Hint 
 - Whenever you make some changes on switch, then always go to see the configuration that you done.
 - In this lab, You got a key to access the next lab, therefore You should need to solved this lab
