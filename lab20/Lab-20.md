## More about Etherchannel load distributio 
Changing the hash may result in a different distribution ratio among the links if they are unevenly distributed. Let’s say a port channel is formed with a router, it will use a MAC address as part of the hash and it might affect traffic flow because the source or destination will always be the router’s MAC address. Using the source/destination IP address or the TCP/UDP ports would be better options.


## Misson 
- Verify that the network engineer correctly configured the EtherChannel, If yes then leave, and if not then configured whole things in the network
- Check that your load distrubution setting was worked correctly, after configuration 


## Hint 
- Use one of the most common command to test the etherchannel load distribution 

Thank You
