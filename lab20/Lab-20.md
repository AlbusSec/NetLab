## More about Etherchannel load distribution

Switch used per flow balancing to balance the load this is the work by which hardware works. Suppose the switch receives the frame, it would make a hash of the source/destination MAC address, or IP address, or Sometimes Port number. It totally depends upon what you want, and for the configuration about this, you need to learn the various method and how it'll be configured. 

## Misson 

- Verify that the network engineer correctly configured the EtherChannel, If yes then leave, and if not then configure whole thing in the network.
- Check that your load distrubution setting has worked correctly, after configuration.

## Hint 

- Use one of the most common command to test the etherchannel load distribution.

Thank You
