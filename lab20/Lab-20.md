## More about Etherchannel load distribution

Switch used per flow balancing to balance the load this is the work how hardware works. Suppose the switch receives the frame it would make a hash of the source/destination MAC address, or IP address, or Sometime Port number it totally depends upon what you want, and for the configuration about this, you need to learn the various method and how it'll be configured. 

## Misson 

- Verify that the network engineer correctly configured the EtherChannel, If yes then leave, and if not then configured whole things in the network
- Check that your load distrubution setting was worked correctly, after configuration 

## Hint 

- Use one of the most common command to test the etherchannel load distribution 

Thank You
