## Introduction to Vlan allowed list

Sometimes, A Network Engineer applies some configuration administratively to limit the VLANs. For example, If the engineer wants to not set limits on VLANs then there is no need to configure anything, but if the engineer wants to define the VLANs. Means, how many VLANs are active or not, then the engineer uses switch port trunk to allow VLAN interface command to limit the VLANs on the switch.


## Misson 
- In this lab, the Network engineer limits some VLANs on a switch, but he forgets to limit the VLANs on both switches.

## Hints
- Use this command 'show interfaces {interface-id} trunk to see the operation trunks informations.

Thank You
